<!-- 
In the below code, the anchor tag (<a>) and image tag (<img>) are used.
- The anchor tag is used to add a hyperlink to a website or a webpage.
- The image tag is used to display an image. You can use either a link to an image (if it's hosted online), or you can add
 local path (if the image is stored on your computer).
- The 'alt' attribute is helpful when the image fails to load. It describes the purpose of the image â€” for example, if the
 image is a logo of Google, the alt text might be "Google Logo".
Note:
- A webpage is a single page displayed in a browser.
- A website is a collection of multiple webpages linked together under one domain.
- A webpage is like a single page in a book, while a website is the entire book made up of many such pages.
