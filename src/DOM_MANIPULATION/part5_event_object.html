<!-- What is an event object?
When you attach an event listener using the addEventListener method, the browser automatically passes an event object to the 
callback function. 
This object contains detailed information about the event, such as what type of event it was, which element it is
targeting, and more.

****************************************** Some General Properties of Event Objects are ********************************
(i) type: - The type of the event (e.g., "click", "keydown", "mouseover").
(ii) target: - The element on which the event originally occurred.
(iii) currentTarget: - The element on which the event listener is currently attached.
(iv) timeStamp: - The time (in ms) when the event was created.
(v) eventPhase: - The phase of the event flow (capturing, at target, or bubbling).
(vi) bubbles: - Returns true if the event bubbles up through the DOM.
(vii) cancelable: - Returns true if the event is cancelable.
(viii) defaultPrevented: - Returns true if preventDefault() was called on the event.
(ix) capture: - Returns true if the listener was registered for the capture phase.

******************************** Most Useful Methods/Properties of Event Objects are: ********************************
(i) preventDefault(): - Prevents the default browser behavior (e.g., prevents form submission).
(ii) stopPropagation(): - Stops the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
(iii) stopImmediatePropagation(): - Stops other listeners of the same event from being called.

  <div class="parent" style="padding: 20px; background-color: #f0f0f0;">
    <button>Click Me</button>
  </div>

  <script>
    // First, I accessed the class "parent" using the document.getElementsByClassName method.
    // Then, I attached an event listener with the event name 'click', which triggers the callback function.
    // The browser automatically passes the event object to this callback function.
    // Now we can access event-related methods and properties using this event object, like event.target.

    // event.target returns the element on which the event occurred (in this case, the button).
    // event.currentTarget returns the element on which the event listener is attached.
    // Here, the click event listener is attached to the div element (class "parent"),
    // so event.currentTarget will refer to the div.

    document.getElementsByClassName("parent")[0].addEventListener('click', (event) => {
        console.log(`event type: ${event.type}`);
        console.log(`event target: ${event.target}`);
        console.log(`event current target: ${event.currentTarget}`);
    });
