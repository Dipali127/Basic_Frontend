<!--
Event handling means listening to events such as (click, hover, input, submit) and responding to them using JavaScript.
→ An event is an action that indicates something has happened in the program, such as the user clicking a mouse button or 
a file being uploaded — these are examples of events.
→ Whenever an event is triggered (called), the event listener listens for that event, takes the corresponding callback or
 handler function, and pushes it to the event queue.
→ The event loop monitors the event queue and passes the event handler (callback function) to the call stack, which then
 executes the logic inside the event handler.

******************************* How an event handler listens to events in JavaScript ************************************
To listen to an event and respond to a user's action, the event handler uses addEventListener(eventName, callback). 
This listens for the specified eventName and executes the logic inside the callback when that event is triggered.

****** NOTE: *******
You can only use valid `eventName`s that are predefined by the DOM. Some examples are:
'click', 'submit', 'keydown', 'mouseover', 'scroll', 'input', 'load', etc.

  // First, we are accessing the HTML element 'button' using the getElementById method.
  // Then we add an event listener using addEventListener with the predefined event name 'click'.
  // Once the user clicks the button on the user interface, a pop-up message 'clicked me!' will be displayed.
  const button = document.getElementById("btn");

  // Using an named function
  button.addEventListener('click', function clickMe() {
    alert("clicked me!");
  });

  // Using an arrow function
  button.addEventListener("click", () => {
    alert("Clicked using arrow function");
  });

  // Using a named function
  function handleClick() {
    console.log("Named function called");
    alert("clicked me!");
  }
  button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);
