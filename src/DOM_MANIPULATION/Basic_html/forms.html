<!-- 
This code explains how to use a form in HTML.
- The <form> tag is used to create a form on a webpage.
- The 'action' attribute contains the URL where the form data should be sent when form is submitted, usually pointing to
 the backend for processing and storing in a database.
- The <label> tag provides a description for the input field, helping the user understand what data is expected 
    (e.g., Name, Email).
- The <input> tag is used to create input fields where users can enter data such as name, age, email, etc.
- The 'for' attribute in the <label> tag and the 'id' attribute in the corresponding <input> tag should match. 
    This links the label to the input field, improving accessibility.
- The <br> tag is used to insert a line break. It is a self-closing tag and does not require a closing tag.
- The <button> tag creates a button on the form, commonly used to submit the form.
