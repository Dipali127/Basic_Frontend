<!-- 
This HTML code demonstrates the use of semantic tags introduced in HTML5. These tags give meaning to the structure of the
 webpage.
1. <header>: Represents the top section of the page, typically used for the website's title or logo. Here, it displays 
    the main heading "MY FIRST WEBSITE".
2. <nav>: Stands for "navigation". It usually contains links or navigation menus. In this example, it contains a short 
    introductory sentence, but typically it would have navigation links.
3. <main>: Represents the main content area of the webpage. It contains the primary information unique to the page.
4. <section>: Used to define a separate section within the page. It often has its own heading and groups related content.
5. <article>: Represents a self-contained piece of content such as a blog post, article, or news item. It can be reused 
    or shared independently.
6. <footer>: Represents the bottom part of the page, often used for contact information, copyright, or links. Here, it
     displays "CONTACT DETAILS".
These semantic tags help search engines and screen readers better understand the structure and purpose of the content.
